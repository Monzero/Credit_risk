Credit scoring &amp; Probability of Default prediction using PD Models for loans. Explore credit risk assessment.

A prominent bank aims to predict the likelihood of customers' credit risks when applying for loans, a concept referred to as PD Models or Probability of Default models.

Credit scoring represents one of the most traditional applications of predictive modeling. It involves forecasting whether granting credit to an applicant will result in profits or losses for the lending institution. The extension of credit to individuals, businesses, or other entities for various purposes, such as buying equipment, real estate, consumer goods, etc., encompasses diverse complexities and methods (credit cards, loans, deferred payment plans). In all instances, lenders provide funds with the expectation of timely repayment with interest, aligned with the risk of default. Credit scoring encompasses decision models and associated techniques that assist lenders in making informed decisions about consumer credit. These methods determine who qualifies for credit, the amount of credit they should receive, and the operational strategies that can maximize borrowers' profitability for lenders. Additionally, they aid in evaluating lending risk. Credit scoring stands as a reliable assessment of an individual's creditworthiness due to its foundation in factual data.

Lenders generally make two primary decisions: firstly, whether to approve credit for new applicants, and secondly, how to manage existing applicants, including considerations like increasing their credit limits. Regardless of the specific techniques employed, it's essential to have a substantial dataset of past customers, including their application details, behavior patterns, and subsequent credit histories, in both scenarios. Most techniques rely on this data to establish correlations between customer characteristics (e.g., annual income, age, tenure with current employer) and their future credit performance.

Typical applications in the consumer market encompass credit cards, auto loans, home mortgages, home equity loans, mail catalog orders, and a diverse range of personal loan products.
